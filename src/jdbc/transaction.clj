  Example:

(defn call-in-transaction
  "Wrap function in one transaction.
  This function accepts as a parameter a transaction strategy. If no one
  is specified, `DefaultTransactionStrategy` is used.

  With `DefaultTransactionStrategy`, if current connection is already in
  transaction, it uses truly nested transactions for properly handle it.
  The availability of this feature depends on database support for it.

  Example:

  (with-connection dbspec conn
    (call-in-transaction conn (fn [conn] (execute! conn 'DROP TABLE foo;'))))

  For more idiomatic code, you should use `with-transaction` macro.

  Depending on transaction strategy you are using, this function can accept
  additional parameters. The default transaction strategy exposes two additional
  parameters:

  - `:isolation-level` - set isolation level for this transaction
  - `:read-only` - set current transaction to read only
